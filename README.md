# googleTestSamples

This is intended for personal use, it includes a start up example on Google Test. It will be updated to use more elaborate examples.

The lib and include files are builded from official googleTest [git repository][gitrep]:

[gitrep]:https://github.com/google/googletest

### How to build example:
```sh
$ cd inside git directory
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
``` 

This will generate a "runme" executable.

To see available options from googleTest:
```sh
$ ./runme --help
```
